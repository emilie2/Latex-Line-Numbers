 Here is an illustration of how to add line numbers.
 You invoke the | add_linenum | command.

 It is wise ot make sure it is your path.
 % which add_linenum
 /afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/babar/bin/add_linenum

 You can then generate a .tex file using it

 % add_linenum paper.tex
 Creating new Tex file paper_linenum.tex
 paper_linenum.tex has been created.
 You can now run latex and create the ps/pdf to see the line numbered document.
